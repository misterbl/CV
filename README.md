## Laurent Bouhnik

I  am Junior Full Stack Developer.

Recent graduate from one of Europe most successful dev bootcamps, I have 10 years experience in recruitment, client relationship and team management.
I have experience in following agile methodologies for project development, working comfortably on my own and within a team.

## Skills
#### Communication

Throughout my career, I have learned how to deal with internal and external clients at all levels. I have worked and lived in 3 different countries, which helped me adapt very quickly to new environments.
I speak fluent French, English and Spanish, and master public speeches and team management.

#### Positive and ambitious

I am ambitious and determined, and always want to do and learn more.
I have often been described as someone who brings positive attitude in the work place. I am always enthusiastic, friendly and never let things or stumbles bring me down. (ah, and I have great hair too! )

#### Quick and curious learner

I have worked in very different industries during my career. From customer service, to sales, HR and recruitment. I have always picked up new skills very quickly and always been eager to learn more.
During my time at Makers Academy, in only 12 weeks, I have learned so many new technologies and I keep on learning new ones at all times, in order to stay up to date with the needs of the market.

#### Entrepreneur

I have created a food delivery business in Mexico. For 2 years I managed the whole process from creating the brand, menu to marketing, recruiting, managing the staff and financial forecast, before selling the business.
